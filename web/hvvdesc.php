<h1>About Vance</h1>
<p>I am Vance Hubbard.  I am a Senior at BYU-Idaho.  
I am two classes, an internship, and project away 
from graduation. I am excited to complete this class 
and to get started with my own business adventures.
I love to invent and use science.  I have some physical
limitations I have had to address.  I have learned a
great deal in web design but wish I had more business
classes.  I love hiking with my two boys and can't wait 
for our next adventure.  I love learning survival and
using the earth for resources and building.</p>
<p> I am going to teach and demonstate making homemade stucco
from paper, water, lime, and mortar.  We may even build a 
pvc stucco bazooka!!!</p>
